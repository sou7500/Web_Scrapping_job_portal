𝗔𝗶𝗺- Retreive email addresses of all hiring managers from the job slides updated on a job portal.

The project looks small but has a great leraning opportunity because the email addresses are stored in an 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗲𝗯𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲.

Thus first the html address of 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗲𝗯𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲 is extracted then using string functions it was converted to complete web page address.

Then using 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽 these web addresses were accessed and required information is retreived.
